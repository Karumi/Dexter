======


Dexter is an Android library that simplifies the process of requesting permissions at runtime.

Android Marshmallow includes a new functionality to let users grant or deny permissions when running an app instead of granting them all when installing it. This approach gives the user more control over applications but requires developers to add lots of code to support it.

The official API is heavily coupled with the ``Activity`` class.
Dexter frees your permission code from your activities and lets you write that logic anywhere you want.

Usage
-----

To start using the library you just need to initialize Dexter with a ``Context``, preferably your ``Application`` as it won't be destroyed during your app lifetime:

```java
public MyApplication extends Application {
	@Override public void onCreate() {
		super.onCreate();
		Dexter.initialize(context);
	}
}
```

Once the library is initialized you can start checking permissions at will. For each permission, register a ``PermissionListener`` implementation to receive the state of the request:

```java
Dexter.checkPermission(Manifest.permission.CAMERA, new PermissionListener() {
	@Override public void onPermissionGranted(String permission) {/* ... */}
	@Override public void onPermissionDenied(String permission) {/* ... */}
	@Override public void onFirstTimePermissionDenied(String permission, PermissionToken token) {/* ... */}
	@Override public void onPermissionRationaleShouldBeShown(String permission, PermissionToken token) {/* ... */}
});
```

To make your life easier we offer some ``PermissionListener`` implementations to perform recurrent actions:

* ``EmptyPermissionListener`` to make it easier to implement only the methods you want.
* ``DialogOnDeniedPermissionListener`` to show a configurable dialog whenever the user rejects a permission request:

```java
PermissionListener dialogPermissionListener =
	DialogOnDeniedPermissionListener.Builder.withContext(context)
		.withTitle("Camera permission")
		.withMessage("Camera permission is needed to take pictures of your cat")
		.withButtonText(android.R.string.ok)
		.withIcon(R.mipmap.my_icon)
		.build();
Dexter.checkPermission(Manifest.permission.CAMERA, dialogPermissionListener);
```

* ``SnackbarOnDeniedPermissionListener`` to show a snackbar message whenever the user rejects a permission request:

```java
PermissionListener snackbarPermissionListener =
	SnackbarOnDeniedPermissionListener.Builder.with(rootView, "Camera access is needed to take pictures of your dog")
		.withOpenSettingsButton("Settings")
		.build();
Dexter.checkPermission(Manifest.permission.CAMERA, snackbarPermissionListener);
```

* ``MultiPermissionListener`` to compound multiple listeners into one:

```java
PermissionListener snackbarPermissionListener = /*...*/;
PermissionListener dialogPermissionListener = /*...*/;
Dexter.checkPermission(Manifest.permission.CAMERA, new MultiPermissionListener(snackbarPermissionListener, dialogPermissionListener, /*...*/));
```


**IMPORTANT**: Remember to follow the [Google design guidelines] [2] to make your application as user-friendly as possible.
